# file-find
File Find program for simplifying common find command searches. Made because VS Code has garbage explorer search.

Just add the directory containing the program to your path to use it.
Example: `ff` lives in `~/scripts`
Then add `PATH="$PATH:~/scripts` in your `.bashrc` file.
Run `source .bashrc`
Use it by typing `ff`.
